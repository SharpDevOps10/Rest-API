# Rest-API-courses
I used Express for Node.js.
The main essence of this repository is to work with HTTP methods and response status codes 
## HTTP methods
I practiced with the following methods, as : 'GET', 'PUT', 'POST', 'DELETE'.

## HTTP response status codes 
The basic successful responses were used, as : `200 OK`, `201 Created`, `204 No Content`.
Furthermore, you can find client error responses, as : `400 Bad Request`, `404 Not Found`.
